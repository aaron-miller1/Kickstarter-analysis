# Kickstarting with Excel

## Analyzing trends of kickstarter campaigns for theatrical plays

### The purpose of this study is to determine ideal goals to set in place in order to better your chances at a successful kickstarter campaign

## Analysis and Challenges

### Through the analysis of Theater as a whole and filtered by month, I was able to discover with the help of a line chart that over the scale of 8 years the data averages the most ideal time to launch a kickstarter campaign in this category to be June or July with over 100 successful campaigns over 8 years compared to the winter months such as January and December being about half that.

### Digging deeper into the Theater category and looking only at plays and their monetary goals, the data shows that campaigns with a goal of less than $1000 tend to fail, with only a 32% success rate. However, the threshold of $1000 to $15000 see a significant increase in success averaging over 90%.

### A challenge that was encountered with the goal based data was the lack of data for higher monetary goals over $20000. These goals all tended to be successful, however with a sample of under 10. The success rate is massively skewed due to lack of information in these ranges.

## Results

- Two conclusions that can be drawn from looking at successful campaigns by their launch date is that the rate significantly increases in the summer months and significantly decreases in the winter months with a sharp drop off coming in September

- In conclusion with outcomes based on their goals, it is safe to say that there is an amount that can be too little to ask for. As shown, goals less than $1000 tended to fail but once the goal was increased between $1000-$15000, success rates rose sharply. Also, the lack of data in th $20000-$50000 does not give a satisfactory conclusion as sample numbers are so small the percentages are biased.

- The main limitation of this data set is the amount of data in some categories leads to biased information.

- Another possible graph to use for outcomes based on goals would be a horizontal bar chart. This more accurately portrays the lack of data in the upper end and allows the viewer to better come to a conclusion on the best goal to set for their campaign.
